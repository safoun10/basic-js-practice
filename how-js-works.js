As much as my 3 days experience says , js takes everything sequentially , it solves every code one by one . It goes to one line , does what it is commanded to be done or it is suppose to do and then goes to the next line/part of the code. Like every other women , js is never wrong , it's either me or my code , js is always right . But one thing that separates js from other women that js always does what I tell it to do . It never argues with me or anything . I love js.
