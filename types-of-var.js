String type variables usually contains texts and enclosed with one or two quotation marks.
Frankly speaking , anything that is within double or single quotation marks is considered as a string type variable .

Numeric refers to numbers . Numeric variables doesn't require any quotation marks .
And you can only assign numbers as a numeric type variable , or else it'll through error .

Boolean type variables can contain only two values . It's either true or false .
