What are the types of variables ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three types of variables . Which are :
 1. string
 2. numeric
 3. boolean

String type variables usually contains texts and enclosed with one or two quotation marks.
Frankly speaking , anything that is within double or single quotation marks is considered as a string type variable .

Numeric refers to numbers . Numeric variables doesn't require any quotation marks .
And you can only assign numbers as a numeric type variable , or else it'll through error .
Numeric type variables have two sub-sector . Those are integer and float .
Basically integer is a whole number and float contains fractions of a number which is just fractions.

Boolean type variables can contain only two values . It's either true or false .
The name "boolean" came from an English Mathematician George Boole in 19th century.
